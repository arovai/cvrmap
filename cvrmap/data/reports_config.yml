    caption: This graph shows the original breathing data with the reconstructed upper envelope and corresponding (units are mmmHg)
      baseline.

      caption: This shows the mask used on the BOLD data to extract the vessel signal timecourse.

  - bids:
      datatype: figures
      suffix: boldmean
      extension: [.svg]
    caption: This graph shows the probe time course and the global BOLD signal (arbitrary units). 
      If using physiological recordings, the probe is the estimated <em>etCO<sub>2</sub></em>, expressed in mmHg.
      If using the vessel signal option, it is the vessel signal time course (in arbitrary units).

- name: Delay maps
  reportlets:
  - bids: {datatype: figures, suffix: delay}
    extension: [.svg]
    caption: Estimated delays (seconds), with the convention that zero delay corresponds to he probe synchronized with global BOLD signal.

  - bids: {datatype: figures, suffix: cvr}

    caption: Estimated CVR (units are % of BOLD signal variation/mmHg)
